== Overview

This project is a server-side application implemented with Vert.x, providing various functionalities such as health checks, authentication with JWT, and external service integrations using PostgreSQL and Redis.

The key functionalities of the project include:

- Setting up an HTTP server with predefined RESTful endpoints.
- Integrating with PostgreSQL and Redis.
- Securing endpoints with JWT authentication.

=== Key Technologies and Frameworks

- **Vert.x:** A reactive programming toolkit for building asynchronous applications.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database integration via connection pooling.
- **Redis:** Integration of a Redis client for caching and key-value operations.
- **JWT:** Authentication and authorization support.

== `HttpServerVerticle` Component

The `HttpServerVerticle` class is the main entry point for starting the HTTP server using Vert.x. Below are its responsibilities:

=== Functionality

- **Health Check Endpoint (`/health`):**
A public endpoint that returns the status of the application.

- **Protected Endpoint (`/name`):**
A secured endpoint that returns hardcoded user information. This requires valid JWT authentication.

=== Integration with External Services

- **PostgreSQL:** Managed using the `PgPoolService` class.
- **Redis:** Redis API is initialized using the `RedisClientService`.
- **JWT Authentication:** Configured using `JwtService`.

=== Class Structure

[subs="attributes+"]
==== Fields

- *Logger*: Used for logging HTTP server activities.

==== Endpoints

- *`GET /health`*: Returns the application status in JSON format:

  +status: UP
  +message: OK
  +data: Current server date and time.

- *`GET /name`*: A secured endpoint that requires a valid JWT token. Returns:

  +name: Hardcoded name of the user.
  +data: Current date and time.

==== HTTP Server Initialization (`start` method)

1. **Connection Pool and Services Initialization**:
- PostgreSQL managed with `PgPoolService`.
- Redis client initialized via `RedisClientService`.
- JWT authentication enabled with `JwtService`.

2. **Route Setup**:
Routes and their handlers are defined. Example:
- `/health`: Handled by `healthHandler`.
- `/name`: Requires `JWTAuthHandler` to validate tokens.

3. **Server Start**:
The HTTP server starts on port `42069`. If successful, a success log is shown.

4. **Failure Handling**:
Logs failures if the server cannot start.

==== Handlers

**`healthHandler`**
Handles the `/health` route and returns:

- JSON response containing:
+status: "UP"
+message: "OK"
+data: Current timestamp.

**`nameHandler`**
Handles the `/name` route and returns:

- A 401 HTTP response if authentication fails.
- A JSON response containing hardcoded user info and the timestamp if authentication is successful.

==== Verticle Shutdown (`stop` method)

The method ensures proper shutdown of the HTTP server and logs its stop message.

=== Key Dependencies

- **PostgreSQL Connection Pool**: Managed by `PgPoolService`.
- **Redis API**: Managed by `RedisClientService`.
- **JWT Authentication**: Controlled by `JwtService`.

== Endpoints Summary

|===
| HTTP Method | URI         | Authentication | Description
| `GET`       | `/health`   | No             | Returns the application's health status.
| `GET`       | `/name`     | Yes (JWT)      | Returns hardcoded user info if authenticated.

== How to Run the Application

- Start the application as a Vert.x verticle:
```bash
java -jar sisyphus-server.jar
```

- Access the endpoints:
- Public health check: `http://localhost:42069/health`
- Protected endpoint: `http://localhost:42069/name` (requires a valid JWT token).

== Dependencies and External Services

This project integrates with the following external services:

- **PostgreSQL Database**:
Used for managing database interactions via connection pooling.

- **Redis**:
A Redis client is integrated for key-value data and caching.

- **JWT Authentication**:
Provides secure access to protected endpoints using JSON Web Tokens.

== Logging

Logs are generated using the `java.util.logging.Logger` class. Typical log events include:

- Successful server initialization with port information.
- Failure message upon server startup issues.
- Shutdown logs when the HTTP server is stopped.

== Building

To launch your tests:
```
./mvnw clean test
```

To package your application:
```
./mvnw clean package
```

To run your application:
```
./mvnw clean compile exec:java
```

== Glossary

- **Verticle**:
A unit of deployment in Vert.x, similar to a microservice.

- **Routing Context**:
Represents the context of a specific HTTP request/response.

- **JWT**:
JSON Web Tokens, used for secure communication and authentication.

- **Redis**:
A high-performance, in-memory key-value database.
